Python argparse wrapper to allow hierarchically nested class based parameters suitable for automatic code analysis especially in [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).
It also provides a unified parameter specification protocol that can be used to provide parameters through both text files and command line.

Please refer to the included parameter skeleton of a large multi object tracking project for which the functionality included in this package was originally developed.

It provides an excellent example of a highly modular project with deeply nested and shared modules.

For example, this is one of the deeper instances of module nesting in this example: Params->Trainer->Target->Templates->Siamese->SiamFC->DesignParams.

Parameter for this configuration can be provided as:

trainer.target.templates.siamese.siamfc.design.exemplar_sz=150

Specifying multiple parameters for a deeply nested module can quickly become cumbersome especially from command line.
The package thus provides a way to group parameters from the same module using the '@' identifier.
An example is provided in [example/cfg/params.cfg](example/cfg/params.cfg).
Note that the indentation used in this file is only for ease of human parsing and is not needed as this system of grouping also works from command line.
Example commands are in [example/deep_mdp.md](example/deep_mdp.md)

Run __python3 main.py --h__ from example folder to see the hierarchical help documentation generated by this package.
