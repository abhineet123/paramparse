Paramparse is a lightweight argparse wrapper to allow hierarchically nested class-based parameters suitable for automatic code analysis / intellisense  in advanced IDEs like [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).    
It also provides a unified parameter specification protocol that can be used to provide parameter values through both text files and command line.

__Note that this readme is quite outdated and paramparse now has lots of advanced text file processing capabilities involving named sections that are not documented here.__    

Please refer to the included parameter skeleton of a large multi object tracking project for which the functionality included in this package was originally developed.
It provides an excellent example of a highly modular project with deeply nested and shared modules.

For example, this is one of the deeper instances of module nesting in this example: 

`Params->Trainer->Target->Templates->Siamese->SiamFC->DesignParams`

Parameter for this configuration can be provided as:

`trainer.target.templates.siamese.siamfc.design.exemplar_sz=150`

Specifying multiple parameters for a deeply nested module can quickly become cumbersome especially from command line.
The package thus provides a way to group parameters from the same module using the __@__ identifier.
An example is provided in [example/cfg/params.cfg](https://github.com/abhineet123/paramparse/blob/master/example/cfg/params.cfg).
Note that the indentation used in this file is only for ease of human parsing and is not needed as this system of grouping also works from command line.
Example commands are in [example/commands.md](https://github.com/abhineet123/paramparse/blob/master/example/commands.md).

The __@__ identifier specifies a prefix `pf` to be added to all subsequent arguments so that `arg_name` is then treated as `pf.arg_name`.    
Assuming `pf=arg1.arg2`, following flavors of __@__ identifier usage are supported:

| __usage__      | __effect__ | __pf__ |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| @_arg3_      | reset _pf_ to _arg3_       | _arg3_       |
| @   |     reset _pf_ to empty    |         |
| @@_arg3_    | add _arg3_ to _pf_     | _arg1_._arg2_._arg3_       |
| @@@_arg3_      | remove rightmost component of _pf_ and add _arg3_     | _arg1_._arg3_       |
| @@@      | remove rightmost component of _pf_       | _arg1_       |

Usage of the package is very simple and involves calling `paramparse.process` as demonstrated in [example/main.py](https://github.com/abhineet123/paramparse/blob/master/example/main.py).

It also provides three converter functions `from_parser`, `from_dict` and `from_function` that can create a parameter class compatible with this package from existing parameters in  `argparse.ArgumentParser` and `dict` formats or using a function's keyword arguments respectively.
The generated class code is either writen to a python source file whose name can be specified as the second argument (defaults to `Params.py`) or copied to clipboard if `to_clipboard=1` is provided (requires [pyperclip](https://pypi.org/project/pyperclip/)).

The `process` function does type inference from the default value of each param but also supports extracting the type from [restructuredText/pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/using-docstrings-to-specify-types.html) type docstring (as generated by the converter functions) if the default is None.

__Note__ : `paramparse` uses the reserved parameter `cfg` to specify paths to text files containing parameter values.
If an existing argparse or dict object to be converted into `paramparse` class already has a `cfg` field used for some other purpose, it will conflict with the parser so please rename this field before or after converting but before running `paramparse.process`.

Usage of converter functions is demonstrated in [example/utils_demo.py](https://github.com/abhineet123/paramparse/blob/master/example/utils_demo.py)

Run `python3 main.py --h` from the example folder to see the hierarchical help documentation generated by argparse.

Apart from the hierarchical nesting and parameter grouping, an important utility of `paramparse` is in the class based representation that allows automated code analysis, navigation and refactoring in IDEs like Pycharm that is not possible when using vanilla `argparse.ArgumentParser` or `dict`.
